  - If results are found, the agent summarizes them concisely and provides URL, 
  - If no results are found, the agent suggests alternative search strategies instead of leaving the user without guidance.  
  - It does not guess or generate content beyond what is retrieved from the knowledge base.  
  - take returned blog posts and pass to summarizeBlogs() for summarization
